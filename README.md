# Flight Booking Prediction

This project predicts whether a customer will complete a flight booking using machine learning (Random Forest). Built as part of the British Airways - Forage Data Science job simulation.

## Project Overview
- Predict target: `booking_complete`
- Features: user behavior, travel details, preferences
- Tools: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Jupyter, Matplotlib

## Steps:
1. Data exploration
2. Preprocessing & feature engineering
3. Model training (Random Forest)
4. Evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall)
5. Feature importance analysis
6. Final presentation


## Result
Achieved 85.25% accuracy with Random Forest.
